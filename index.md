## About Me

I am passionate about Computer Science and since I was a child I'm being interested in Computers so I decided to
study Multimedia Engineering in La Salle University (Barcelona) and focus my career to Software Engineer.

Currently I do some coding in *Adstream Ltd UK* as *Scala Developer*.
